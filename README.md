A simple text-based RPG game I am making to practice Python. It has no meaningful story to speak of.

Presently, the game has a few locations, a few actions to take, and a simple win(?) condition. It also features several functions which can be performed from all locations -- pulling up a help menu, checking the inventory, checking present location, moving to a new location, and checking the places to which one can move. There is also now a simple user interface made with tkinter that allows the player to play the game without using the command line and offers buttons to perform global functions, as well as quit the games and modify settings. At the moment, the only setting is to change the color of the text.

Currently, I am working on expanding the story with new locations and actions, as well as allowing the player to perform an action multiple ways (i.e. the game should probably accept "toss [item]" where it also accepts "throw [item]").
